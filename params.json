  "body": "## Monica\r\nMonica is a [Go](https://golang.org) project that helps developers avoid repeating commands by defining a structured `.monica.yml` config file.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n```\r\nsudo curl -sSo /usr/bin/monica https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenati/monica/master/monica && sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/monica\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Manual download\r\nEvery new Monica version is released using Github Releases and the latest release download links are available here:\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/zenati/monica/releases/latest\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are all available plateforms:\r\n```\r\ni386\r\namd64\r\narmhf\r\ndarwin_386\r\ndarwin_amd64\r\nfreebsd_386\r\nfreebsd_amd64\r\nfreebsd_arm\r\nlinux_386\r\nlinux_amd64\r\nlinux_arm\r\nnetbsd_386\r\nnetbsd_amd64\r\nnetbsd_arm\r\nwindows_386\r\nwindows_amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example of use\r\nLet's say we need to type almost everyday the following commands:\r\n- rake assets:clobber assets:precompile\r\n- git add -A\r\n- git commit -m 'A commit message that nobody will care about'\r\n- git push origin master\r\n\r\nHere is what the `.monica.yml` file would look like:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nengine: monica\r\nreactions:\r\n  - name: push\r\n    desc: Pushing current branch to ${b} on Github\r\n    content:\r\n      - command: git add -A\r\n      - command: git commit -m '${m}'\r\n      - command: git push origin ${b}\r\n\r\n  - name: com-push\r\n    desc: Precompiling assets and pushing to Github\r\n    content:\r\n      - command: rake assets:clobber assets:precompile\r\n      - reaction: push #Reusing reaction above with name 'push'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe config file should be placed at the root of the git repository to be detected and parsed by `monica`. Once done, you can call the following command :\r\n```\r\nmonica push -b master -m \"commit message\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nor to precompile and push using commit message with staging branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmonica com-push -b staging -m 'commit message'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n```\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Yassine Zenati\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
